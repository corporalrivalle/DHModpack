# HorrorPack

HorrorPack is a modpack compiled by myself that has corruption and horror as a central basis. There are two key mods that play a central role in this.

1. The Man in the Fog (Adds a demon that deals high damage at random intervals)
2. Fight or Die (Adds corrupted entites that each have special effects and cause difficulties)

This modpack will be expanded slowly to balance out player and adversarial interactions. 

### Modpack Changes

- 4/6/2024: Initial Commit of Modpacks. Mods include Bonfires, Epic Fight, The Man from the Fog, Epic Knights (EF addon), Epic Knights Japanese Armor (EF addon), architectury (dependency), cloth-config (dependency), Fight or Die, geckolib (dependency), Realm Miner.
- 4/7/2024: Added Mods for QOL and slight balance readjustment in favor of the playergroup. Additions include: JADE, Patchouli (dependency), Ars Nouveau, Corpse, Curios (dependency), JEI.

### Planned Changes

The following mods are planned to be added to the modpack. Each mod will also have an estimated date in which it will be added to the modpack, as well as a reason.

- MineColonies (4/8/24): This addition is to add new NPCs for the player to leverage in dealing with or avoiding Fight or Die corrupted entities in caverns. Specifically, the town guards, and miners are ideal in gathering resources and defending areas from these mobs, as cavern diving is extremely dangerous even with mid-game gear when in contact with FoD mobs like the corrupted endermen.
- Create (4/8/24): The addition of Create is aimed at providing solutions to automation and other issues that may be made extraordinarily difficult by FoD mobs.
- Eureka Ships (4/8/24): This addition aims to provide new modes of transportation to the player, as well as options for mobile base operations and better world exploration options.
- Towns & Towers (4/8/24): This addition aims to spice up overworld surface exploration, as currently there is not a large incentive to explore.
- Xaero's Minimap (4/8/24): Aims to provide QoL via minimap.

Additionally, more biomes and other world generation/exploration mods are under survey for addition into the modpack. 

### Balancing Rationalization

- Bonfires: Allow players to waypoint teleport at a balanced cost.
- The Man from the Fog: Adds an early game adversarial entity.
- Epic Fight, Epic Knights, Epic Knights Japanese Armor: Adds mid-game weapons and unique fight mechanics beyond jump clicking.
- Fight or Die: Adds mid-to-end game difficulty mobs to provide challenges to players that lay outside of the "grindy" zone of influence.
- Realm Miner: Adds some end game items to mitigate difficulty from FoD
- JADE: QoL
- Ars Nouveau: Counterbalance difficulties faced from FoD mobs preventing resource gathering. Gives better controls to players, and gives tools for avenues around having to face FoD mobs in a "Soviet Union" style numbers vs numbers grind.
- Corpse: QoL counterbalance to FoD difficulty, as to not lose items. Balanced in the fact that FoD mobs can take over these corpse bodies and attack players with them.
- JEI: QoL
