# TechPack

Techpack is a Civilization/Techonology centric fork of [HorrorPack](./HorrorPack). The goal of this pack is to encourage the development of minecolonies, and especially on a server, trade and interactions with players in other nations.

The central role of the player is to act as the head of a minecolonies nation-state. Custom world generation packs will ensure resource scarcity governed by biomes, to encourage logical settlement and infrastructure development.

### Modpack:

The modpack currently includes the following mods:

- Epic Fight
  - Epic Knights
  - Epic Knights Japanese Armory
- Create
  - Create Armory

  - Multipiston
  - Clockwork
  - Eureka
  - Trackwork (To Be Added)
- Fight or Die
- Various QoL Mods
  - JADE
  - JEI
  - Xaero's Minimap

These mods were selected to give players a difficult start, and difficulties surviving alone, requiring the development of a mine colony and its accompanying military strength. Leveraging their colony as an industrial base, players can then move onto create to industrialize and develop better and higher level economies.
