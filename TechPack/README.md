# TechPack

Techpack is a Civilization/Techonology centric fork of [HorrorPack](./HorrorPack). The goal of this pack is to encourage the development of minecolonies, and especially on a server, trade and interactions with players in other nations.

The central role of the player is to act as the head of a minecolonies nation-state. Custom world generation packs will ensure resource scarcity governed by biomes, to encourage logical settlement and infrastructure development.
